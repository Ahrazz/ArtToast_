            <h1>The History of Modern Art</h1>
            <p>Modern art is a broad term that encompasses artistic works produced from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. During this period, artists began to explore new techniques, forms, and perspectives, often breaking away from classical traditions to experiment with more abstract and unconventional styles.</p>
            <p>Key movements in modern art include Impressionism, Cubism, Surrealism, and Abstract Expressionism. Each of these movements sought to redefine the boundaries of what art could be, challenging traditional notions of beauty and representation.</p>
            <p>Artists like Pablo Picasso, Jackson Pollock, and Salvador Dal√≠ were pivotal in shaping the modern art landscape, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to influence contemporary artists today.</p>
