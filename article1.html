        <h1>The History and examples of Toast Art</h1>
        <p>In her Tokyo kitchen, Sasaki concocted chic culinary creations on a carb canvas—think homages to Picasso and Mondrian, recreations of Edo-era paintings, abstract nods to Mickey Mouse, and even an edible take on American comic book art. Then, she posted the stylized results on her Instargam account, @sasamana1204. “The reason I started doing toast art was lockdown. I was spending an hour and a half commuting to work, but working from home led me to wake up late and get lazy,” Sasaki tells Vogue. “I wanted to get up early in the morning and create a morning routine that would excite me. That's when I started the toast art for breakfast.”</p>
        
        <p>Toast means a simple, yet classic approach to art.</p>
        
        <p>Today, modern toast art continues to inspire new generations of artists, with its legacy visible in galleries, museums, and exhibitions around the world.</p>
