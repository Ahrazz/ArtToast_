        <h1>The History of Modern Art</h1>
        <p>Modern art refers to artistic works produced between the late 19th century and the mid-20th century. It represents a departure from traditional forms and embraces experimentation with new techniques, media, and subjects.</p>
        
        <p>This era saw the emergence of movements such as Impressionism, Cubism, Surrealism, and Abstract Expressionism. Artists like Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, and Salvador Dal√≠ revolutionized the art world with their groundbreaking work.</p>
        
        <p>Today, modern art continues to inspire new generations of artists, with its legacy visible in galleries, museums, and exhibitions around the world.</p>
